Outside Resources
-----------------
In order to figure out how to use getopt_long(), I used the following resources: 
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt-Long-Options.html
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt-Long-Option-Example.html

Moreover, I used this page to learn how to write a Makefile:
http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/

I also used this page to learn how to write the "make check" section of the Makefile:
https://blog.melski.net/2010/11/15/shell-commands-in-gnu-make/

Testing Methodology 
------------------- 
For my smoke test for the "make check", I implemented the following tests: 
> correctly implements --input and --output and returns 0 
> check to see if correctly copies input to output 
I was unable to check for cases where it exited without return 0 because the 
Makefile would not continue executing afterwards since it thought it had 
encountered an error in the program.
