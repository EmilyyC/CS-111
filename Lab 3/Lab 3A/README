CS 111 Project 3A: File System Dump
===================================

Included Files
==============
lab3a.c -- the C source file for our project, which analyzes and summarizes a file system's contents
Makefile -- to build the program and tarball
README -- descriptions of each of the included files and additional information

Testing Methodology
===================
I tested my program by saving all of the ".csv" files provided as solutions in a directory called "solutions" and then checked if my program had the correct output by taking the "diff" of my files and the solution files.
